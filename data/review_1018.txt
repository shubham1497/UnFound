A film that is not funny but makes you smile wide because it makes you think, chew, mull. If you can't handle a "different" kind of love story - the practical, the contemporary, the possible - just shhhush away this instant! No need to read further. If you think you are game for a romantic film that is well thought over - don't go on reading this, book your ticket and one for me too. I can watch this one with each one of you again and again! The world wide web won't eat the detailed review before you come back, I promise!
