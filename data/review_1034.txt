The main story and the various sub-plots are interesting, but unfortunately lack punch. The narrative is as flat. Nothing out-of-the-ordinary happens and you are left dissatisfied with the build-up and finale. The choreography and dances are nothing to swear by either. Some capable new actors brought on board though.
